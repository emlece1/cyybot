“CyyBot 3.0: Advanced Spotify Automation Tool”
Introduction:
Welcome to our tutorial showcasing CyyBot version 3.0, a cutting-edge Spotify bot designed to generate authentic streams from genuine accounts, ensuring undetectable operation and generating valid revenue streams. In this tutorial, we will explore the bot’s features and provide step-by-step instructions on how to effectively utilize its capabilities.

Installation and Setup:
CyyBot 3.0 comes with a user-friendly installation package. Upon installation, you will find convenient shortcuts on your desktop for “Close all chrome,” “CyyBot,” and “Proxy Checker.” The bot utilizes a serial-based mechanism to ensure secure access and prevent unauthorized usage.

User Interface:
The bot offers a streamlined interface with four essential function buttons: Start Bot, Stop Bot, Users, and Check Proxies.
Users Button:
The Users button opens a window with three main tabs:

Proxy Tab: Add your proxies here to ensure secure and anonymous operation.
Accounts Tab: Input your Spotify user accounts, which will be used for streaming. The number of instances opened is based on the number of user accounts added, allowing you to deploy up to 1 million accounts depending on your computer’s processing power.
Used Proxies Tab: This tab displays the proxies that have been utilized by the Chrome instances.

Deploying the Bot:
After entering the necessary details in the Users window, click the Start button to deploy the bot. A window will appear with two options:

Enter Spotify Song URL: Paste the URL of the specific song you want to stream.
Collections Button: Automatically navigate to your liked songs collection for streaming.
Custom Playlist URL: Fix your custom playlist URL for targeted streaming.

Bot Functionality:
For this case, we are going to use a virtual private server.
Once deployed, CyyBot 3.0 navigates to Spotify.com and employs an auto-login mechanism to access your accounts. It then navigates to the specified playlist or collections list, initiates playback, and ensures the repeat button is activated using artificial intelligence. In case of any errors or proxy issues, you can close the affected instance, and the bot will automatically select a new proxy from the Proxy tab and resume the automation process seamlessly.
Stopping the Bot:
To halt the streaming process, simply press the Stop button. This will trigger the mechanism to close all active Chrome instances and terminate the bot itself.
Proxy Management:
CyyBot 3.0 includes a Check Proxy button, allowing you to verify the functionality of your proxies. It intelligently removes non-functioning proxies, ensuring optimal performance and organization throughout the automation process.
